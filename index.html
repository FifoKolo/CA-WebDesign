			<b><p>Sustainability for land is crucial for the protection of the planet, us and animals. It is estimated that the area the size of 2 Chinas, are in poor condition and dont produce crops and oxygen as efficiently as they should be. By cutting down trees, this will lower the production of oxygen and will lower the widlife survival rate which will impact endangered species. </p class="paragraph1">

			<div class="t2">
			<b><p>Sustainability for Land is really important because, in estimate 28% of oxygen is produced just from trees. However, trees produce now more oxygen more efficeintly due to the high quality land we use to grow trees and use healthier and stronger fertilisers for the trees to boost the production of oxygen even further than ever before. Oxygen also benefits our life span and reduces the risk of getting sick.</p></div>

			<h2>How to Sustain Land ?</h2>
			<div class="t3">
			<b><p>There are many ways to easily sustain land. Such as, planting more trees, driving less and using Hydrogen powered vehicles or electric vehicles to reduce the production of carbon dioxide in the air. By quitting smoking, you will prevent polluting the air which will keep the air clean but also benefit the health for others in the area.</p></div>
